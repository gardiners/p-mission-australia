Repository for a potential Data for Democracy project spawned from the Sydney datahackathon 2018.

## Goals ##

* Predict best geographic areas for targeted new-donor campaigns.
* Work from the hypothesis that people are more likely to donate to charities with local activities, and which are therefore servicing a local need. 
* Develop a methodologically-sound (ie theory-grounded) approach to the new-donor geographic prediction problem. 

## Structure ##
* `/src` for scripts.
* `/data`
    * `raw` for source data. Ideally read-only.
    * `clean` for cleaned, processed, linked, synthesised data etc. 
* `/pub` for presentations, reports etc.
